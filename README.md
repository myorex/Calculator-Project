# Calculator-Project
Building a calculator using HTML, CSS and javascript

What This Handles Correctly

✔ Single pair evaluation at a time
✔ 12 + 7 - 1 = → 18
✔ No evaluation on consecutive operators
✔ Pressing new digit after result starts new calculation
✔ Clear resets everything
✔ Decimal input (single dot only)
✔ Backspace works
✔ Keyboard support
✔ Divide by zero handled safely
✔ Long decimals rounded
